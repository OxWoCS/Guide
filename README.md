# :beetle: LaDebug :computer:
A lesson series organized by the Oxford Women in Computer Science Society (OxWoCS) to teach undergraduates how to use various tools, how to start working on different types of projects, and a variety of random, useful pieces of information to make their time at Oxford a little bit easier.

These lessons target students with no (or very little) previous knowledge/experience in the tools/skills being taught. OxWoCS aims to create a **comfortable environment** for students to learn skills they did not have the opportunity to develop in high school (or during their first few years at Oxford).
